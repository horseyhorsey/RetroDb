# RetroDb Importer

## What is it?

Bulk importing Hyperspin games lists to database. Rocketlauncher statistics are also imported.

## How to use

    dotnet RetroDbImporter.dll "I:\Hyperspin" "I:\Rocketlauncher"

## How it works

When bulk importing it uses your Hyperspin Main Menu to know which Systems to import.

The database is created in the same directory you run the importer from.
